  <h3 class="boxed" > Introduction  </h3>
<p>    Hi, I’m Tova!  I graduated with a degree in biomedical engineering, but late into my degree I realized that my true passion was programming.  I’ve tried for many years to attain a job in programming but without success.  Among the ways that I’ve taught myself are through textbooks, online course specializations, Kata on Codewars, and working through hundreds of algorithms in interview textbooks.
I ran into a problem when I applied for interviews.  There’s a lot of things in computer science I’ve never heard of, and I often felt like I was in over my head. I lacked a strong grasp of fundamentals.  I have a keen sense of how badly I need structures, and mentors I can turn to.

  <h3 class="boxed" > Why I Love Programming   </h3>
<p>  For me programming is the perfect mix of left and right brain skills.  I love math and I come from an engineering background, and I’m also a writer and a musician.  Programming is a wonderful fusion between the right and left brain and a tremendously creative outlet.  The more constraints there are in programming, the more creativity it seems to demand.    
When I first started solving algorithms in Codewars it took me a while to figure out what I was doing.  I started mulling over possible solutions as I was watching the dishes or taking the dog for a walk.  At night right before I fell asleep some possible answer for a problem I couldn’t figure out before would suddenly hit me, and I would fall asleep really excited.  
When I program I feel like a small child playing a game.  I want to spend the rest of my life that way.

      <p>  
        I have:
  <ul>
    <li>Studied a textbook on C++.</li>
    <li>	Taken 2 algorithm courses on Coursera. </li>
    <li>	Take a CodeAcademy course on algorithms.Taken CodeAcademy and KhanAcademy courses on Java Script. </li>
    <li>	Taken CodeAcademy and KhanAcademy courses on Java Script.  </li>
<li>Taken a 5-course specialization in Coursera: data structures and OOP. </li>
<li> Attended a weekly programming group called ‘She Codes.’</li>
<li> Solved collections of algorithms in Java from interview books.	</li>
        </ul>

  <div class="sectAbout" style="padding:30px 30px 0 30px; width: 30.8%;">
      <p>      Also in doing the prerequisites for this course, I tried to push beyond what was required.  I did some extra sections in FreeCodeCamp and also reached level 4 in Codewars.  I’ve never coded in HTML before and my code for thiss website is probably not very elegant.  However, I put my whole heart into it and I hope it shows.  
I really want to show that I care and that I’m committed.

  <h3 class="boxed" >Why 'Founders & Coders'</h3>

<p>   After trying to study computer science on my own for a while, I’ve come to realize that what I’ve been doing until now has not been enough.  I really need structure, framework, and mentors I can turn to.  That’s exactly what Founders & Coders comes in.  
I’m still in shock that such a program exists where people are willing to give up their time and energy, and where former students give back by volunteering their own time, and I’d really like to be part of it.  I believe firmly in the power of giving and volunteering – in the past I’ve spent several years volunteering with disabled children, as well as recent Ethiopian immigrants to Israel.  I do a lot of work teaching and tutoring as well, so I think I’d be a great fit for the Founders & Coders community.  
Another factor that is appealing about the course is the people.  From what I’ve researched, the students who attend the course are genuinely happy to be there, and the atmosphere is positive and buoyant.  I think the people around you have a huge impact on how you learn and work.  I really want to be around people who are as passionate and excited about learning as I am.  I’ve experienced a taste of that already, through the Gitter community for this course.  Even though we’re all competing each other, everyone is eager to help each other out and give advice and help.  I think that’s really special.

        <a name = "What I Have to Offer"> </a>    
  <h3 class="boxed" >What I Have to Offer As a Programmer</h3>
<p> I’m bright, creative, and hard-working.  Much more importantly, I have great drive and passion.  
  I genuinely love learning - I taught myself programming and I woke up before sunrise every morning in order to do it.  </p> 
      <h1 style="color:red;"> I think my work ethic and passion are really rare, and the most valuable commodities I have to offer.

 <a name = "What I Would Do"> </a> 
<h3 class="boxed">    What I'd Do If I Was Accepted </h3>
<p>    My dream is to be an entreupreneur, and there are a few projects Iàve started working on.  I think programming, and especially website programming, is crucial in business today.
The most important project to me )SP= is my EdTech (Education Technology) project.  Since I teach standardized tests, I’ve developed very specific techniques for memorizing and succeeding (S) in material.  I was surprised when I did some research and discovered that most companies which help you prepare for exams like the SAT tend to use similar, and not really efficient, techniques.  I’ve developed a well-articulated system of my didactic techniques and also developed (S) an idea for a website – how these ideas could work through a website – but I lack the programming skills to actually code such a website.  
Also, one of my dreams is to become an astronaut in the next 6/7 years.  I think having a really strong foundation in coding would be really important in developing (S) my qualities for such a position.  And I think I could really make Founders & Coders proud.
