  <h3 class="boxed" > Introduction  </h3>
<p>     Hi, I’m Tova!  I graduated with a degree in biomedical engineering, but late into my degree I realized that my true passion was programming.  I’ve tried for many years to attain a job in programming, but unfortunately without success.  Among the ways that I’ve taught myself are through textbook, course specializations on data structures and OOP on Coursera, doing algorithms on Codewars, and working through hundreds of algorithms in a collection intended for interviews.
However, I ran into a problem when I applied for interviews.  There were a lot of technical things that I had no knowledge of, and it seemed that there was a broad expanse to programming which I still hadn’t touched.
I realized that I was lacking a strong grasp of fundamentals which people with a more formal education have.  I need structure, a framework, and I need mentors I can turn to.  That’s exactly what Founders & Coders offers.  
Another factor that is appealing about the course is the people.  From what I’ve researched, the students who attend the course are genuinely happy to be there, and the atmosphere is positive and buoyant.  I think the people around you have a huge impact on how you learn and work.  I really want to be around people who are as passionate and excited about learning as I am.
Also, it’s exciting (S) that the course is being run (S) by volunteers, and was founded through idealism, love of the material (S).  That’s a factor that I have tremendous admiration for.

        <a name = "Why I Love Programming"> </a>    
  <h3 class="boxed" > Why I Love Programming   </h3>
<p>    I love programming because I think I have the perfect mix of left brain and right brain skills.  For examples, I love math and I come from an engineering background.  However I also love writing and music and showing my creative side.  One of the things I love most about programming is that it’s the perfect fusion between the right and left brain, and it’s a wonderful expression of creativity.  One of the things I’ve learned from working in algorithms is that paradoxically, the more constraints there are the more creativity they demand.  I look at coding as a creative cchallenge and I enjoy teasing out a solution and that’s a lot of fun.  
When I’m programming I feel like  a child who’s playing a fun new game.

    <div class="sectWID">
      <p>      
  <ul>
    <li>Went through  a book on C++.</li>
    <li>	Gone through 2 courses on Coursera about algorithms. </li>
    <li>	Gone thrugh code academy and Khan academy on a cooruse on Java Script. </li>
    <li>	Gone through a course on Code Academy for algorithms. </li>
<li>Done a 5-course specialization in Coursera from the University of San Diego for algorithms. </li>
<li> Gone every week, both in Tel Aviv as well as in Jerusalem, to a group called ‘She Codes’, to ask for help and learn from other programmers.  
  This was not successful becayse the group is made of a few volunteers and few were able to answer the questions I had.</li>
<li>	Gone through almost every algorithm in a difficult book called Interview Algorithms, 
  in order to increase my understandning of data structures and algorithms. </li>
        </ul>

      <p>Even in doing the prerequisites for this course, I hope I’ve shown that I’m really dedicated and committed.  I did extra sections in FreeCodeCamp such as Bootstrap in Htmal, as well as intermediate and advanced algorithms.  In Codewars, I did more Kata in order to reach my current level, level 3.  I tried to make my website as advanced as I could, even though my knowledge of HTML and CSS is really limited.  My point was to show that I really care, and that I’m committed.
I enjoy coding and really like Codewars; if there’s something which eldaves me stumped, I often to figure it out as I’m washing the dishes or at the grocers; often, right before I go to bed, I fgure it out.

  <h3 class="boxed" >Why 'Founders & Coders'</h3>
<p>   From introduction
Because I don’t have any major job right now – I’m working as a teacher – I can’t really afford to go to a major school. I’ve put a lot of effort into online classes and from my experience they’re not enough.   I need structure and framework.  I’m still in shock that such a program exists where people are willing to give up their time and energy, and where former students give back by volunteering their own time, and I’d really like to be part of it.

        <a name = "What I Have to Offer"> </a>    
  <h3 class="boxed" >What I Have to Offer As a Programmer</h3>
<p>   I think that I’m bright, creative, and hard-working.  But I think the most important thing I have to offer is 
I love learning new things!  And also, a have wonderful drive and passion.  I genuinely love learning, and I push myself – I taught myself programming and would wake up early every morning in order to do it, and I think I have great work ethic, without anyone having to push me.  I think this is a rare and valuable quality, and the greatest thing I have to offer.  

I hope that my passion shines through!   In everything here I really tried to go the extra mile, for example I tried to write more than one Kata and I also did some more algorithms questions or sections of the Bootstrap, which were not required of us.  I think it’s really important to stress that this is not something recent for me – this is something I’ve been working on already for several years, and working hard!   Even in my website, even though my ccoding is not the most elegant, I really hope it shines through that I tried as hard as I can to make this website as nice as I could.

 <a name = "What I Would Do"> </a> 
<h3 class="boxed">    What I'd Do If I Was Accepted </h3>
<p>    My dream is to be an entreupreneur, and there are a few projects Iàve started working on.  I think programming, and especially website programming, is crucial in business today.
The most important project to me )SP= is my EdTech (Education Technology) project.  Since I teach standardized tests, I’ve developed very specific techniques for memorizing and succeeding (S) in material.  I was surprised when I did some research and discovered that most companies which help you prepare for exams like the SAT tend to use similar, and not really efficient, techniques.  I’ve developed a well-articulated system of my didactic techniques and also developed (S) an idea for a website – how these ideas could work through a website – but I lack the programming skills to actually code such a website.  
Also, one of my dreams is to become an astronaut in the next 6/7 years.  I think having a really strong foundation in coding would be really important in developing (S) my qualities for such a position.  And I think I could really make Founders & Coders proud.
