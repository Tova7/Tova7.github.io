  <h3 class="boxed" > Introduction  </h3>
<p>    Hi, I’m Tova!  I graduated with a degree in biomedical engineering, but late into my degree I realized that my true passion was programming.  I’ve tried for many years to attain a job in programming but without success.  Among the ways that I’ve taught myself are through textbooks, online course specializations, Kata on Codewars, and working through hundreds of algorithms in interview textbooks.
I ran into a problem when I applied for interviews.  There’s a lot of things in computer science I’ve never heard of, and I often felt like I was in over my head. I lacked a strong grasp of fundamentals.  I have a keen sense of how badly I need structures, and mentors I can turn to.

  <h3 class="boxed" > Why I Love Programming   </h3>
<p>  For me programming is the perfect mix of left and right brain skills.  I love math and I come from an engineering background, and I’m also a writer and a musician.  Programming is a wonderful fusion between the right and left brain and a tremendously creative outlet.  The more constraints there are in programming, the more creativity it seems to demand.    
When I first started solving algorithms in Codewars it took me a while to figure out what I was doing.  I started mulling over possible solutions as I was watching the dishes or taking the dog for a walk.  At night right before I fell asleep some possible answer for a problem I couldn’t figure out before would suddenly hit me, and I would fall asleep really excited.  
When I program I feel like a small child playing a game.  I want to spend the rest of my life that way.

      <h1 style="font-family:Brush Script MT;">  Learning to Program So Far: </h1>

      <p>  
        I have:
  <ul>
    <li>Studied a textbook on C++.</li>
    <li>	Taken 2 algorithm courses on Coursera. </li>
    <li>	Take a CodeAcademy course on algorithms.Taken CodeAcademy and KhanAcademy courses on Java Script. </li>
    <li>	Taken CodeAcademy and KhanAcademy courses on Java Script.  </li>
<li>Taken a 5-course specialization in Coursera: data structures and OOP. </li>
<li> Attended a weekly programming group called ‘She Codes.’</li>
<li> Solved collections of algorithms in Java from interview books.	</li>
        </ul>

  <div class="sectAbout" style="width: 30%; padding:30px 30px 0 30px;">
      <p>      Also in doing the prerequisites for this course, I tried to push beyond what was required.  I did some extra sections in FreeCodeCamp and also reached level 4 in Codewars.  I’ve never coded in HTML before and my code for thiss website is probably not very elegant.  However, I put my whole heart into it and I hope it shows.  
I really want to show that I care and that I’m committed.

  <h3 class="boxed" >Why 'Founders & Coders'</h3>

<p>   After trying to study computer science on my own for a while, I’ve come to realize that what I’ve been doing until now has not been enough.  I really need structure, framework, and mentors I can turn to.  That’s exactly what Founders & Coders comes in.  
I’m still in shock that such a program exists where people are willing to give up their time and energy, and where former students give back by volunteering their own time, and I’d really like to be part of it.  I believe firmly in the power of giving and volunteering – in the past I’ve spent several years volunteering with disabled children, as well as recent Ethiopian immigrants to Israel.  I do a lot of work teaching and tutoring as well, so I think I’d be a great fit for the Founders & Coders community.  
Another factor that is appealing about the course is the people.  From what I’ve researched, the students who attend the course are genuinely happy to be there, and the atmosphere is positive and buoyant.  I think the people around you have a huge impact on how you learn and work.  I really want to be around people who are as passionate and excited about learning as I am.  I’ve experienced a taste of that already, through the Gitter community for this course.  Even though we’re all competing each other, everyone is eager to help each other out and give advice and help.  I think that’s really special.

  <h3 class="boxed" >What I Have to Offer As a Programmer</h3>
<p> I’m bright, creative, and hard-working.  Much more importantly, I have great drive and passion.  
  I genuinely love learning - I taught myself programming and I woke up before sunrise every morning in order to do it.  </p> 
      <h1 style="color:red;"> I think my work ethic and passion are really rare, and the most valuable commodities I have to offer.

<h3 class="boxed">    What I'd Do If I Was Accepted </h3>
<p>   My dream is to be an entrepreneur, and there are a few projects I’ve started working on. Although programming is obviously the foundation of any tech business, I think it’s crucial for any business today.  
The project closest to my heart is one in EdTech (Education Technology).  I prepare people for standardized tests like the SAT or GMAT, and I was surprised to discover that the main companies coaching students how to take these exams all use the same – and often inefficient – methods.  
For example, when it comes to memorizing vocabulary words, the companies advise using flashcards and increasing your reading time.  Actually, there are a few specific mnemonic methods which make learning new vocabulary words easy and fast, in a way which doesn’t require a lot of study time but which you’ll still remember years later.  For example, one such method is visualization.  Neurologically, the part of our brain responsible for memory is strongly related to our visual system.  When we link things we want to remember to visual images, they become much easier to remember.  When I teach words to my students this way , they’re able to memorize a few dozen words in half an hour, and they still remember them months later.  
I want to design a website to teach people how to study well and efficiently for their standardized tests. In general I have a passion for teaching people how to study and how to learn, and I also think this has a great business market.  I’ve figured out the content of what I wanted to put out and have drawn out what I want it to look like, but I don’t yet know how to program it. 

I also think that programming is an integral part of other things I’m currently doing.  For example, I’m currently working on plans to expand my tutoring business to an online international business instead of a face-to-face regional one.  An  online business would be logistically simpler, more lucrative, and less time-consuming, and some programming knowledge is important to me in building it.  
 One of my biggest dreams is to become an astronaut in the next 5-10 years. I think having a really strong foundation in coding would be really important in developing (S) my qualities for such a position. And I think I could really make Founders & Coders proud.
