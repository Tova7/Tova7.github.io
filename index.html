  <h3 class="boxed" > Introduction  </h3>
<p>    Hi, I’m Tova!  I graduated with a degree in biomedical engineering, but late into my degree I realized that my true passion was programming.  I’ve tried for many years to attain a job in programming but without success.  Among the ways that I’ve taught myself are through textbooks, online course specializations, Kata on Codewars, and working through hundreds of algorithms in interview textbooks.
I ran into a problem when I applied for interviews.  There’s a lot of things in computer science I’ve never heard of, and I often felt like I was in over my head. I lacked a strong grasp of fundamentals.  I have a keen sense of how badly I need structures, and mentors I can turn to.  

        </p>

    <div class="section3">
        <a name = "Why I Love Programming"> </a>    
  <h3 class="boxed" > Why I Love Programming   </h3>
<p>   For me programming is the perfect mix of left and right brain skills.  I love math and I come from an engineering background, and I’m also a writer and a musician.  Programming is a wonderful fusion between the right and left brain and a tremendously creative outlet.  The more constraints there are in programming, the more creativity it seems to demand.    
When I’m programming I feel like a child playing a fun new game.  I really want to spend the rest of my life this way.

      <h1 style="font-family:Brush Script MT;">   What I've Done In Order to Learn </h1>

      <p>  
        I have:
  <ul>
    <li>Studied a textbook on C++.</li>
    <li>	Taken 2 algorithm courses on Coursera. </li>
    <li>	Take a CodeAcademy course on algorithms.Taken CodeAcademy and KhanAcademy courses on Java Script. </li>
    <li>	Taken CodeAcademy and KhanAcademy courses on Java Script.  </li>
<li>Taken a 5-course specialization in Coursera: data structures and OOP. </li>
<li> Attended a weekly programming group called ‘She Codes.’</li>
<li> Solved collections of algorithms in Java from interview books.	</li>
        </ul>
                                      </p>
    </div>
    
  <div class="sectAbout" style="padding:30px 30px 0 30px; width: 30.8%;">
      <p>Even in doing the prerequisites for this course, I hope I’ve shown that I’m really dedicated and committed.  I did extra sections in FreeCodeCamp such as Bootstrap in Htmal, as well as intermediate and advanced algorithms.  In Codewars, I did more Kata in order to reach my current level, level 3.  I tried to make my website as advanced as I could, even though my knowledge of HTML and CSS is really limited.  My point was to show that I really care, and that I’m committed.
I enjoy coding and really like Codewars; if there’s something which eldaves me stumped, I often to figure it out as I’m washing the dishes or at the grocers; often, right before I go to bed, I fgure it out.

  <h3 class="boxed" >Why 'Founders & Coders'</h3>

<p>   From introduction
Because I don’t have any major job right now – I’m working as a teacher – I can’t really afford to go to a major school. I’ve put a lot of effort into online classes and from my experience they’re not enough.   I need structure and framework.  I’m still in shock that such a program exists where people are willing to give up their time and energy, and where former students give back by volunteering their own time, and I’d really like to be part of it.

         <div class="section3">
        <a name = "What I Have to Offer"> </a>    
  <h3 class="boxed" >What I Have to Offer As a Programmer</h3>
<p>   I think that I’m bright, creative, and hard-working.  But I think the most important thing I have to offer is 
  I love learning new things!  And also, a have wonderful drive and passion.  </p>
           
           
           
           <h1 style="color:red;">
  I genuinely love learning, and I push myself – I taught myself programming and would wake up early every morning in order to do it, 
 
           </h1>
           
 <p>  and I think I have great work ethic, without anyone having to push me.  I think this is a rare and valuable quality, and the greatest thing I have to offer.  

I hope that my passion shines through!   In everything here I really tried to go the extra mile, for example I tried to write more than one Kata and I also did some more algorithms questions or sections of the Bootstrap, which were not required of us.  I think it’s really important to stress that this is not something recent for me – this is something I’ve been working on already for several years, and working hard!   Even in my website, even though my ccoding is not the most elegant, I really hope it shines through that I tried as hard as I can to make this website as nice as I could.

 <a name = "What I Would Do"> </a> 
<h3 class="boxed">    What I'd Do If I Was Accepted </h3>
<p>    My dream is to be an entreupreneur, and there are a few projects Iàve started working on.  I think programming, and especially website programming, is crucial in business today.
The most important project to me )SP= is my EdTech (Education Technology) project.  Since I teach standardized tests, I’ve developed very specific techniques for memorizing and succeeding (S) in material.  I was surprised when I did some research and discovered that most companies which help you prepare for exams like the SAT tend to use similar, and not really efficient, techniques.  I’ve developed a well-articulated system of my didactic techniques and also developed (S) an idea for a website – how these ideas could work through a website – but I lack the programming skills to actually code such a website.  
Also, one of my dreams is to become an astronaut in the next 6/7 years.  I think having a really strong foundation in coding would be really important in developing (S) my qualities for such a position.  And I think I could really make Founders & Coders proud.
